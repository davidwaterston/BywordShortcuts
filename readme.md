# **Flashcards for Byword Keyboard Shortcuts (Mac)**
v1.0.0

##What is it?
A set of flashcards that cover the essential keyboard shortcuts ("hot keys") available in *Byword* on the Mac OSX operating system. Multiple formats are included to allow import into most popular Flashcard apps.  
*Byword* is a MultiMarkdown editor made by MetaClassy.  

These shortcuts were current at version 1.5.1.


##What's included?
There are 5 files included with this package:   

- **readme.md**  
This file.

- **Byword Keyboard Shortcuts (Mac) - Tilde.txt**  
The shortcuts in *tilde-delimited* (~) format. These can be imported into many applications such as quizlet.com or flashcardexchange.com.
The file is tilde rather than comma-delimited because some of the definitions contain a comma. Most apps will allow you to specify the delimiter character so this file will import into the vast majority of applications. 
For some applications to recognize the file you may have to change the extension.

- **Byword Keyboard Shortcuts (Mac) - Tab.txt**  
The shortcuts in *tab-delimited* (~) format. The second most popular format, when tilde-delimited is not supported.
For some applications to recognize the file you may have to change the extension.

- **Byword Keyboard Shortcuts (Mac) - Excel.xls**  
The shortcuts in Microsoft Excel 97-2004 format. These can be imported into apps such as studyblue.com which don't support tilde or tab-delimited files.  
This file can also be used to easily export the file to other formats.

- **Byword Keyboard Shortcuts (Mac) - Mental Case.studyarch**  
The shortcuts in *Mental Case* Study Archive format. *Mental Case* is a popular Flashcard application available for Mac OSX and iOS. Although it supports many import formats, "Study Archive" is the most convenient.
