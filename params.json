These can be imported into many applications such as quizlet.com or flashcardexchange.com.\r\nThe file is tilde rather than comma-delimited because some of the definitions contain a comma. Most apps will allow you to specify the delimiter character so this file will import into the vast majority of applications. \r\nFor some applications to recognize the file you may have to change the extension.\r\n\r\n- **Byword Keyboard Shortcuts (Mac) - Tab.txt**  \r\nThe shortcuts in *tab-delimited* (~) format. The second most popular format, when tilde-delimited is not supported.\r\nFor some applications to recognize the file you may have to change the extension.\r\n\r\n- **Byword Keyboard Shortcuts (Mac) - Excel.xls**  \r\nThe shortcuts in Microsoft Excel 97-2004 format.
